        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        
        <h3>TechTrend started as a group of friends who loved playing with gadgets.

            In those early days, we faced challenges, like figuring out how to make our ideas work with limited resources. But with determination and a lot of trial and error, we built our first tech gadgets. When our creations caught people's attention, we officially became TechTrend.
            
            Our first product was a hit, and that encouraged us to dream bigger. From that garage, we grew into a real company. Although we've come a long way from those early experiments, our commitment to making awesome tech accessible to everyone remains the same.
            
            Now, TechTrend is more than just a garage project. We've got a team of tech enthusiasts, and our gadgets are used by people worldwide. </h3>
